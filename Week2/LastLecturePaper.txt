I really enjoyed the Last Lecture video. I went in with an open mind and ready to hear what was in store and figure out why it was called Last Lecture. When Randy Pausch started talking about his livers in the begging I understood why. Randy wants to show us that we choose and define what we do with out lives. Randy said that we may not get to choose the cards we are dealt in life but we do get to choose how we play the hand we get dealt. Those words are powerful, just because something isn't going your way or you're at a road block don't give up keep going. Make the most out of what you got and have and use it to your advantage. Road blocks or brick walls are not meant to stop us but to make us show how bad we want things in life. Life is all about wanting something everyone wants something. It's up to you to decide to get there, nothing is impossible. I could relate to Randy's way of thinking because I don't like to let things stop me rather than push me to try harder. I really loved when Randy was talking about the projects going on at Disney, it was really interesting because I didn't even know they had projects like that going on during that time period. My Uncle used to be the head mechanical engineer for the rides at Disney Land in Orlando. I used to talk with him for hours about the rides, he would share details of how they would work and would even bring out huge engineering books to show me designs of the rides and how some of the mechanics worked. These have always been very wonderful memories for me as I never got to see my uncle much. I enjoyed the VR project with the Happy world being created and then being abandoned and destroyed. I bet that was lots of fun to work on and create as well probably took a lot of time and I love seeing how much love and care is put into peoples projects. I will need to get a copy of Randy's book to see what other information he has to share as he was very inspiring.
