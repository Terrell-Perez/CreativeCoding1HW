Learning styles definitely affect how we learn. No one is going to learn the same as the person next to them. I am mostly a visual learner and I have known this since about the second grade. Learning styles can also hold someone back if they aren't put into the right environments when trying to learn. For example if someone who is a visual learner they wont do to well if they space they are trying to learn has lots of nearby noise. or if a visual learner can't see very well what they are trying to learn they may not retain much of the information.
