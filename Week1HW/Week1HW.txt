CLI (Command-Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) have their uses, and both can be used to get the same job done, each with its advantages and disadvantages. CLI is a text-based interface meaning that you use text rather than an interface with buttons like GUI. One of the disadvantages of CLI is that it requires memorization of commands, but with practice and time, they will come to you in an instant. CLI is very fast once you know how to use it compared to GUI because it allows you to quickly add, remove, copy, view, and do all sorts of other useful tasks, sometimes being able to complete more than one task in a single command or spell ðŸ˜Š. Now let's talk about GUI, this is a visual interface where you interact with the system using elements such as menus, buttons, and other sorts of icons around the interface. Most people who create folders on their computers use the GUI interface, it is a very friendly interface to use making it easy for beginners and more visually appealing. GUI will accomplish the same tasks as CLI however it is slower than using CLI and having to do everything yourself rather than some tasks being automated. No matter what you choose to use both interfaces will get the task done. I look forward to learning more about CLI!
